notes
from inventory excel sheet
-> export as csv
-> run script to remove all commas and create seperate column for denominator so numerical value and sign (cent) are seperated
  -> can add more sanitation if needed


IDEAS
for images, establish a naming convention for each image when uploaded to godaddy file manager that uses a unique identifier (like inventory number) so it can be access when inventory is rendered

  for example: 
  {
        "Inv_NUM": "14383",
        "Country": "US",
        "Date": "1955 Bugs Bunny",
        "Denomination": "50c",
        "Type": "Franklin",
        "Grade": "MS-63",
        "Cost_Code": "AATR",
        "Date_Code": "HBTA",
        "Cost": "$15.00",
        "Price": "20.0",
        "Profit": "18.0",
        "Status": "Available",
        "DateEntered": "2410",
        "Denomination_Value": "50",
        "Denomination_Unit": "c"
    },
      the picture for this should be named imageAPIkey_14383
        if there is a second picture for this it should be named imageAPIkey_14383-b
      then this picture can now be access at http://broadwaycoin.com/images/imageAPIkey_14383

      then we can use the product itself to create the src url path without having to store the path
