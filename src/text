notes
from inventory excel sheet
-> export as csv
-> run script to remove all commas and create seperate column for denominator so numerical value and sign (cent) are seperated
  -> can add more sanitation if needed
Questions
how are data currently being entered

the comma for currency was messing  with the data import

are you able to come up with what you want for the category and subcategory
